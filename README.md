# INR-Predictor

## Background

INR (Indian National Rupee), is official currency of India. Exchange rate of USD($) to INR(₹) is one of the most important indicators of health of Indian economy. Inflation in the country is many-a-times linked to the rise in this exchange rate. Hence, forecasting of rupee can give valuable insights of economy to investors and companies.

Although the value of rupee is dependent on market conditions, it also bears a relationship with time. In this project I explore this relationship between exchange rate of INR and time, and forecast rupee value using deep learning LSTM models.
